Objective

The objective of this change was to implement a retry mechanism for the cf login command during PCF application deployments. The intention was to reduce failures caused by intermittent login or timeout issues. The retry mechanism was designed to attempt the login up to three times, with a 30-second interval between attempts, and capture the execution details for monitoring and analysis.

2. Implementation Plan

A change ticket was created and the implementation plan was reviewed with Asharaf.

Approval for implementation was received from Faisal.

The changes were implemented in the following components

The initial implementation included:

Script changes to support retry attempts (maximum of 3 with 30 seconds delay).

Logging execution details into a CSV file with the following columns:

Application Name

Microservice Name

Number of Attempts

Execution Status

Execution Date

3. Observations – Day 1

The retry mechanism executed as per the design.

However, it was observed that the password was being exposed in the console logs during the cf login execution.

Despite retry attempts, the timeout issue persisted, and the deployment continued to fail after three retries.

4. Additional Fixes Implemented – Day 2

Based on the initial observations, further changes were made to improve the implementation:

Password Exposure Fix

Introduced set +x before the cf login command to suppress sensitive information (password) from being printed in the logs.

CF_HOME Isolation per Attempt

Modified the script to export a unique CF_HOME path for each retry attempt (temp-1, temp-2, temp-3).

Ensured necessary plugins were copied into each temporary folder to allow the login command to execute independently across attempts.

5. Observations – Day 2 Monitoring

The updated script successfully suppressed the password exposure in the logs.

Retry mechanism functioned as expected with isolated CF_HOME directories.

However, due to the uDeploy High Availability (HA) activity performed recently, the overall deployment time had increased.

The addition of three retry attempts caused the deployment time to increase further.

The original timeout issue was not resolved; the login continued to fail after retries in certain cases.

6. Conclusion

The initial objective of masking sensitive information was achieved successfully.

The retry logic executed correctly and captured details in the CSV file.

However, the approach did not solve the core timeout problem and introduced an additional drawback of increased deployment time.

Overall, the solution is not considered effective for addressing the observed issue.

7. Next Steps / Recommendations

Further analysis is required to determine the root cause of the timeout during cf login. Some recommended next steps are:

Investigate network or PCF authentication latency that may be causing the timeouts.

Explore the possibility of using token-based authentication instead of repeated cf login executions.

Review plugin behavior and caching mechanisms to see if optimization can reduce repeated login overhead.

Evaluate whether connection retries should be implemented at the network/request layer instead of at the cf login command level.

8. Change Ticket Closure

The change ticket has been closed after documenting the above findings. The retry mechanism implementation will not be pursued further in its current form, and a separate analysis activity will be initiated to identify a more effective solution.
