Objective

The objective of this change is to ensure continued functionality and compliance of all self-service deployments in CloudBees CD by replacing the deprecated EC-JIRA plugin with the EC-REST plugin. This will guarantee that integrations remain stable, secure, and supported beyond September 30, 2025, while minimizing risk to ongoing release and deployment processes.

Scope

This change applies to all CloudBees CD self-service deployment configurations where EC-JIRA is currently being used. The activities include:

Identifying and replacing EC-JIRA with EC-REST in:

Create Release processes

Property merge configurations

Deployment templates

Validating that all integrations with JIRA via EC-REST function as expected.

Performing regression testing to ensure no impact to existing release orchestration and deployment pipelines.

Documenting updated configurations and communicating the change to stakeholders.

Out of Scope

Any non-CloudBees CD integrations with JIRA.

Enhancements or new feature requests unrelated to this plugin replacement.

Do you want me to also suggest a high-level timeline & rollout steps for this plan?

Got it üëç. Here‚Äôs how you can frame Impact Analysis and Backout Plan for your change ticket implementation plan:

Impact Analysis

Functional Impact

All self-service deployments using EC-JIRA will stop working after September 30, 2025, if not migrated.

Replacing with EC-REST ensures JIRA ticket creation, updates, and property merges continue seamlessly.

Minor functional differences may exist between EC-JIRA and EC-REST requiring configuration adjustments.

Business Impact

If not implemented, release and deployment automation relying on JIRA will fail, leading to manual intervention, delayed releases, and increased operational overhead.

Successful implementation ensures uninterrupted automation and compliance with supported plugins.

Risk Assessment

Low to Medium Risk: Since only plugin replacement is involved, existing processes remain intact.

Potential risk of misconfiguration in mappings or API calls during migration.

Regression testing is necessary to mitigate failure in release creation or deployment.

Backout Plan

In case of any failure or unexpected impact during/after migration:

Restore Previous Configuration

Retain a backup/export of all workflows, property merges, and deployment templates prior to replacement.

Revert from EC-REST back to EC-JIRA plugin in CloudBees CD configurations.

Rollback Deployment

Redeploy the previously backed-up configurations using CloudBees CD import functionality.

Validate that all deployment pipelines are restored and functional.

Communication

Inform stakeholders about rollback execution.

Provide details of failure and next steps for re-planning the migration.

Next Attempt

Conduct root cause analysis of the failure.

Address configuration gaps and reschedule migration with corrective measures.

Do you also want me to draft a Step-by-Step Implementation & Rollout Plan (with pre-checks, execution, validation, and post-checks)? That will make the change ticket look complete.

Got it ‚Äî you need the post-implementation impact analysis (i.e., what the effects will be after the change is successfully implemented). Here‚Äôs how you can frame it for your document:

Impact Analysis (Post-Implementation)

Functional Impact

All CloudBees CD self-service deployments (Create Release, Property Merge, Deployment Templates) will use EC-REST instead of the deprecated EC-JIRA plugin.

JIRA ticket operations (create, update, property mapping) will continue to function without disruption.

Slight differences in configuration (e.g., REST API parameters) may require updated documentation for release managers and DevOps teams.

Business Impact

No disruption to ongoing or future releases and deployments after September 30, 2025.

Ensures compliance with CloudBees CD supported plugins and avoids dependency on deprecated components.

Reduces risk of last-minute failures and unplanned manual interventions.

Operational Impact

Teams may need minor retraining/awareness on using EC-REST plugin configurations.

Operational overhead will be reduced in the long term as future support issues with EC-JIRA are avoided.

Monitoring dashboards and audit logs will reflect EC-REST usage going forward.

Risk After Implementation

Minimal risk, provided validation and regression testing are successful.

Any issues discovered later can be managed using the backout plan (rollback to EC-JIRA configuration backups).

Would you like me to also add a Post-Implementation Validation Checklist (like steps to confirm everything works fine after the change)? That usually strengthens change tickets.
