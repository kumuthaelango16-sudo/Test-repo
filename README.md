Went Well

I would like to appreciate everyone for their effort throughout the year, especially those who extended their support during production releases.

This year has been a strong learning curve for the team, particularly around production pre-validations and production release support.

The team is consistently following the standard Agile process. Special thanks to Sindhura for guiding us in adopting Agile practices effectively.

The cross-training knowledge sessions conducted every Friday have been valuable, helping the team understand various initiatives and ongoing work.

Team coordination has been good, with members helping each other whenever needed.

Although we initially lacked proper documentation for initiatives, we have improved by creating documents for user stories this year.

Needs Improvement

We had issues with the burndown chart this year. To improve, the team should focus on completing one story at a time—pick a new story only after the previous one moves to validation. Once validation is completed, close the story promptly. This will reflect accurate burndown progress.

The team should finalize the technical approach before starting implementation, as many gaps are currently being identified during PR reviews.

We should improve adherence to sprint timelines—closing the sprint on Wednesday and starting the new sprint on Thursday at the beginning of the workday.

Team members should take complete ownership of their tasks until they reach the “Closed” status.

We need to ensure that poker planning is conducted in every sprint, as it has proven beneficial.

Repeated weekend activities related to the platform should be handed over to the platform team to avoid unnecessary weekend workload for our team.

Let me know if you'd like this formatted as bullet points, an email, or added to a Confluence page style.

Year-End Retrospective – Summary & Improvements

Went Well

Thanks to everyone for the hard work this year, especially those who supported during production releases.

This year gave all of us a good learning experience, especially with production pre-validations and production release activities.

The team is following the Agile process well. Thank you, Sindhura, for guiding us.

The Friday cross-training sessions helped everyone understand different initiatives and the overall work.

Team coordination has been good, and members supported each other whenever needed.

Earlier, we did not have enough documentation, but this year we improved by creating documents for each story.

Needs Improvement

We had issues with the burndown chart. To improve, the team should try to work on one story at a time. After moving a story to validation, they can pick the next one. Once validation is done, close the story so the burndown shows correct progress.

The team should finalize the approach before starting the work. Many gaps are being found during PR reviews.

We should close the sprint on Wednesday and start the next sprint on Thursday morning without delays.

Team members should take full ownership of their tasks until the stories are completely closed.

Poker planning should be done in every sprint since it was useful.

Weekend platform activities should be handed over to the platform team so our team does not have to stretch on weekends.
