Implementation Document

Title: Change Window Validation using IBM UDeploy and ServiceNow Integration

1. Purpose

The purpose of this implementation is to introduce an automated control that ensures deployments are executed strictly within the approved change windows defined in ServiceNow change tickets. At present, deployments may be triggered without a direct check against the authorized window, which can lead to compliance issues, failed audits, or disruptions in production environments. By integrating IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UDeploy) with ServiceNow through the Change Deployment Window plugin, the deployment process will validate the current system time against the start and end times specified in the change ticket. If the time falls within the valid window, the deployment process will continue; otherwise, the process will be aborted automatically. This approach minimizes manual oversight, reduces risk, and enforces adherence to organizational change management policies.

2. Scope

This implementation applies to all deployments executed through IBM UDeploy that are initiated from the CloudBees CD self-service deployment release pipeline. When a release pipeline is executed in CloudBees CD, the change ticket details will be passed as inputs to UDeploy. UDeploy, in turn, will validate the ticket details against ServiceNow before executing the actual component process. This integration ensures that the enforcement of change windows is consistent across environments, starting with lower-level test systems and ultimately extending to production environments.

3. Approach

The solution will leverage the ServiceNow Change Deployment Window plugin that is available within IBM UDeploy. This plugin enables UDeploy to communicate directly with ServiceNow via its REST APIs. The plugin requires a set of inputs such as the ServiceNow instance URL, the change ticket ID, the ticket‚Äôs start and end dates, and valid integration credentials.

The end-to-end process will function as follows:

A deployment is triggered in CloudBees CD through a self-service release pipeline.

As part of this execution, the change ticket details (ticket ID, start date, and end date) are passed from CloudBees CD into UDeploy.

UDeploy uses the ServiceNow plugin to connect to the ServiceNow instance, authenticate with the provided credentials, and retrieve the details of the specified change ticket.

The plugin validates the current system time against the approved start and end dates of the change ticket.

If the current time falls within the defined window, UDeploy allows the component process to proceed. If the time is outside the window, the process is aborted automatically, and the deployment does not move forward.

This approach ensures that every deployment is governed by the ServiceNow change management process, and no deployment bypasses the approved time frame.

From a security perspective, the ServiceNow credentials will not be hardcoded or exposed in pipeline scripts. Instead, they will be securely stored and managed by the Platform Team in UDeploy‚Äôs credential store, ensuring that only authorized processes can access them.

4. Prerequisites

Before this implementation can be executed, the following prerequisites must be satisfied:

A functional IBM UDeploy environment must be available and configured to accept deployment triggers from CloudBees CD.

The ServiceNow instance must be accessible from the UDeploy environment. Network connectivity, including firewall and proxy configurations, should be verified in advance.

A ServiceNow service account with appropriate permissions (read access to change requests) must be created and shared by the Platform Team.

The Change Management module in ServiceNow must be enabled and actively used by the organization.

The ServiceNow Change Deployment Window plugin must be installed and available in the UDeploy plugin catalog.

5. Validation

The approach has already been reviewed and confirmed by the technical leads. Initial discussions with the Platform Team have verified that network connectivity between UDeploy and ServiceNow exists and is functional. Additionally, the availability of the ServiceNow Change Deployment Window plugin within UDeploy has been confirmed.

The next step of validation will take place during a test sprint, where different deployment scenarios will be executed. These scenarios will verify that the plugin correctly validates the change window and responds appropriately when the deployment falls outside the allowed time frame.

6. Roles and Responsibilities

The successful implementation of this solution requires collaboration across multiple teams:

Platform Team is responsible for providing the ServiceNow integration credentials, validating connectivity between UDeploy and ServiceNow, and securely storing the credentials in UDeploy.

DevOps Team will be responsible for configuring the plugin within UDeploy, integrating it into the deployment process, and conducting test deployments. The team will also handle any required scripting to manage the flow of data from CloudBees CD to UDeploy.

Change Management Team will ensure that all change tickets in ServiceNow are created with accurate start and end dates. They will also monitor compliance with the new process and validate that deployments are occurring within authorized windows.

7. Testing Plan

To ensure robustness, the following test cases will be executed:

Positive Test Case: Trigger a deployment within the approved change window. The deployment should proceed as expected.

Negative Test Case: Attempt to deploy outside the approved window. The deployment should be aborted by UDeploy.

Invalid Ticket Test: Provide an incorrect or non-existent change ticket ID. The process should fail gracefully and not proceed.

Credential Test: Use expired or invalid credentials to validate error handling. The deployment should fail with an authentication error.

Successful completion of these scenarios in lower environments will provide confidence to move the solution into production.

8. Risks and Mitigation

There are several risks associated with this implementation:

Incorrect or incomplete change ticket details may block valid deployments. This risk will be mitigated by educating change managers and enforcing validation checks at the time of ticket creation.

Plugin or integration failures could halt deployments unexpectedly. To mitigate this, a fallback procedure will be in place where the validation step can be temporarily disabled in UDeploy until the issue is resolved.

Credential expiry or mismanagement may prevent the plugin from authenticating with ServiceNow. Regular credential rotation schedules will be enforced by the Platform Team.

Network outages may prevent connectivity between UDeploy and ServiceNow. In such cases, deployments will be temporarily blocked until connectivity is restored.

9. Backout Plan

In case the integration causes deployment disruptions, the validation step in UDeploy can be disabled quickly to allow deployments to proceed without ServiceNow validation. During this time, change windows will be validated manually by the Change Management Team until the issue with the plugin or configuration is resolved. If necessary, a rollback to the previous pipeline configuration will also be performed.

10. Next Steps

The immediate next step is to coordinate with the Platform Team to obtain the necessary ServiceNow credentials and configure them securely in UDeploy. Once credentials are in place, the DevOps Team will implement the validation step into the deployment process and conduct testing across multiple scenarios in the upcoming sprint. Following successful validation in lower environments, the integration will be promoted to production pipelines.
