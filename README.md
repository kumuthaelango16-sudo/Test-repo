Hi [Manager’s Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I would like to formally request a release from my current project. As my H1B visa validity is approximately 1.5 years, I need to start exploring opportunities that align better with my long-term visa and career requirements.

Additionally, my husband will be traveling to the US (Atlanta) this Friday. Due to this, I will be solely responsible for taking care of my child and may not be able to support second-shift work hours going forward.

Considering the above reasons, I kindly request your support in releasing me from the project. I will ensure a smooth transition and complete all knowledge transfer activities as required.

Thank you very much for your understanding and support.

Warm regards,
Ajay

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I would like to discuss my request for release from the current project. With my H1B visa expiring in approximately 1.5 years, I need to start planning for a project that supports long-term continuity.

In addition, my husband will be traveling to the US this Friday, and I will be managing my child’s responsibilities on my own. Due to this, it will be difficult for me to continue supporting second-shift work.

Given these circumstances, I kindly request your understanding and approval for my release from the project. I will ensure all my responsibilities are transitioned smoothly.

Thank you for your consideration and support.

Best regards,
Ajay
