Story Title:

Enabler – Document accelerator approach for migrating UDeploy configurations to CloudBees CD

Description:

As part of the migration initiative from UDeploy to CloudBees CD, we need to define and document an accelerator approach to streamline and standardize the migration process.
This story focuses on analyzing the existing UDeploy configuration structure, identifying reusable patterns, and formulating a step-by-step migration approach. The outcome will serve as reference documentation for future migrations.

Scope of Work:

Analyze existing UDeploy configuration structure and deployment models.

Identify common components, reusable templates, and integration points.

Evaluate mapping between UDeploy entities (applications, components, processes) and CloudBees CD equivalents.

Define a high-level migration approach/accelerator framework.

Document the migration approach, best practices, and any prerequisites.

Share the documentation for internal review and feedback.

Deliverables:

Draft document outlining the migration/accelerator approach.

Mapping matrix between UDeploy and CloudBees CD configurations.

Finalized documentation published in the team’s knowledge repository (e.g., Confluence or SharePoint).

Acceptance Criteria:

✅ UDeploy configuration analysis completed and documented.

✅ Mapping of UDeploy entities to CloudBees CD entities is clearly defined.

✅ High-level accelerator-based migration approach documented with steps and examples.

✅ Document reviewed and approved by key stakeholders.

✅ Final version uploaded to the designated documentation repository.
