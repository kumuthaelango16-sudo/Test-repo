was planning to work on the dynamic worker node setup this morning, but CloudBees CI Dev is down. I have shared the update in the catch-up chat and prepared a detailed document on the pod anti-affinity fix steps and findings.

I’m on planned leave today for my mother-in-law’s treatment. I’ll try to log in tonight to sync up on the CF_HOME process changes.
