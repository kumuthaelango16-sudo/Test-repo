Please review your current sprint stories and create the necessary sub-tasks before the daily scrum call.
If any stories require Lead validation, assign the respective sub-tasks to the Leads and ensure they are visible on the board, so Leads can provide updates during the scrum.
Verify that each story includes a proper description and updated acceptance criteria.
If you have any questions or need clarity, discuss them with the Leads.
Kindly make sure to follow this process for all future sprints.
