Implementation Document

Title: Change Window Validation using IBM UDeploy and ServiceNow Integration

1. Purpose

The purpose of this implementation is to ensure that deployments are executed only within the approved change window defined in ServiceNow change requests. By validating the current system time against the ServiceNow ticket‚Äôs start and end dates, we prevent unauthorized or out-of-window deployments, thereby maintaining compliance and minimizing production risks.

2. Scope

Applies to deployments triggered via IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD).

Integration leverages the IBM UCD ‚Äì ServiceNow Change Deployment Window Plugin.

Validation covers:

ServiceNow Change Ticket details (Start Date, End Date).

Current system time of deployment execution.

Action:

If current time is within change window ‚Üí Execute component process.

If current time is outside change window ‚Üí Abort process.

3. Approach

Plugin Usage

Use the ServiceNow Change Deployment Window plugin in IBM UDeploy.

Inputs required:

ServiceNow URL

Change Ticket ID

Start Date & End Date

Username & Password (integration credentials)

Process Flow

Deployment triggered in UDeploy.

Plugin connects to ServiceNow via REST API using provided credentials.

Plugin fetches change ticket details and validates:

If current time ‚â• Start Date and ‚â§ End Date ‚Üí allow deployment.

Otherwise ‚Üí abort deployment.

Security

Credentials stored securely in UDeploy (encrypted).

Access controlled via Platform Team‚Äôs credential management.

4. Prerequisites

IBM UDeploy environment set up and operational.

ServiceNow instance accessible from UDeploy nodes.

ServiceNow Change Management module enabled.

Service account credentials with read access to change tickets.

Firewall/network connectivity validated between UDeploy and ServiceNow.

5. Validation

Design Review: Approach confirmed with Leads.

Connectivity Check: Platform Team validated UDeploy ‚Üî ServiceNow communication.

Plugin Availability: Verified plugin is available in UDeploy catalog.

Dry Run: To be executed in non-production environment.

6. Roles & Responsibilities

Platform Team:

Provide ServiceNow credentials.

Validate connectivity.

Manage credential storage.

DevOps Team:

Configure plugin in UDeploy.

Implement process flow with validation step.

Conduct testing in lower environments.

Change Management Team:

Ensure tickets are updated with correct start and end dates.

Approve change window validations.

7. Testing Plan

Positive Scenario

Trigger deployment within valid change window ‚Üí Deployment proceeds.

Negative Scenario

Trigger deployment before/after window ‚Üí Deployment aborted.

Invalid Ticket

Provide incorrect change ticket ID ‚Üí Deployment fails gracefully.

Credential Issue

Test invalid credentials ‚Üí Validate error handling.

8. Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Impact	Mitigation
Incorrect ServiceNow ticket dates	Deployment blocked or bypassed	Educate change managers; enforce date validation
Plugin failure	Deployment may fail unexpectedly	Fallback process to abort deployment
Credential expiry	Plugin authentication fails	Regular credential rotation with Platform team
Connectivity outage	Integration fails	Retry mechanism and fallback alerts
9. Backout Plan

If integration causes deployment failures, disable the Change Deployment Window validation step in UDeploy.

Revert to manual validation of change window until issue is fixed.

Escalate to Platform team if ServiceNow plugin errors persist.

10. Next Steps

Coordinate with Platform Team to obtain and configure ServiceNow credentials.

Implement validation step in UDeploy pipelines.

Test scenarios during upcoming sprint.

Rollout in production environment after successful validation.

Would you like me to also add a diagram (process flow) showing UDeploy ‚Üí ServiceNow ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Deployment outcome? That can make the document more visual and easier for leads to understand.

Here‚Äôs a smoother rephrased version of your line:

‚ÄúThe change ticket details will be passed from CloudBees CD as part of the self-service deployment release pipeline execution.‚Äù

Would you like me to insert this into the Approach section of your implementation document under Process Flow, so it reads more naturally in context?
