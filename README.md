Jira Align Dependency Title

Dynamic Worker Node Migration ‚Äì Application Team Configuration and Validation

Description

As part of the migration from static worker nodes to dynamic worker nodes, the DevOps team requires support from the Application team to ensure successful integration and validation.

The Application team is requested to:

Configure the dynamic worker node label in their respective build/deployment pipelines.

Validate and test that all necessary software dependencies and configurations are available on the new dynamic worker nodes.

Provide a sign-off once validation is completed successfully.

After successful validation, the Application team must update all pipelines to use the dynamic worker node label.

Acceptance Criteria

Application team configures the dynamic worker node label in at least one pipeline for testing.

All required software dependencies and configurations are validated successfully on the dynamic worker node.

Application team provides confirmation/sign-off on successful execution.

Dynamic worker node label is updated across all pipelines managed by the application team.

Summary / Title:
Dynamic Worker Node Migration ‚Äì Application Team Configuration and Validation

Description:
As part of the migration from static worker nodes to dynamic worker nodes, the DevOps team requires support from the Application team to complete the following activities:

Configure the dynamic worker node label in the pipelines managed by the Application team.

Validate that all necessary software dependencies, tools, and configurations are available and functioning correctly on the new dynamic worker nodes.

Perform end-to-end testing of their pipelines to ensure successful execution using the dynamic worker nodes.

Provide a sign-off/confirmation once validation is completed successfully.

Once validated, the Application team should update all their pipelines to permanently use the dynamic worker node label.

Dependency Type:
Deliverable Dependency (Configuration and Validation)

Needed By (Target PI/Iteration):
[Specify your PI or Sprint here ‚Äì e.g., PI-4 / Sprint 2]

Status:
Open / In Progress / Accepted (choose based on current stage)

Expected Outcome:
All application pipelines are configured and successfully executing using dynamic worker nodes, with Application team sign-off provided.

Additional Notes (optional):
DevOps team will provide any required guidance or configuration details related to dynamic worker setup during the validation phase.
