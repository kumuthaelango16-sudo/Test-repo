Went Well

Thanks to everyone for the hard work this year, especially those who supported during production releases.

This year gave all of us a good learning experience, especially with production pre-validations and production release activities.

The team is following the Agile process well. Thank you, Sindhura, for guiding us.

The Friday cross-training sessions helped everyone understand different initiatives and the overall work.

Team coordination has been good, and members supported each other whenever needed.

Earlier, we did not have enough documentation, but this year we improved by creating documents for each story.

Needs Improvement

We had issues with the burndown chart. To improve, the team should try to work on one story at a time. After moving a story to validation, they can pick the next one. Once validation is done, close the story so the burndown shows correct progress.

The team should finalize the approach before starting the work. Many gaps are being found during PR reviews.

We should close the sprint on Wednesday and start the next sprint on Thursday morning without delays.

Team members should take full ownership of their tasks until the stories are completely closed.

Poker planning should be done in every sprint since it was useful.

Weekend platform activities should be handed over to the platform team so our team does not have to stretch on weekends.
