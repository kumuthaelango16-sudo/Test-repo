I am still in the process of recovering, and both my child and I are currently down with a high fever and throat infection. I am also experiencing difficulty speaking today. Given the situation, I will need to take leave for the day.

I will ensure that my pending tasks are completed by extending my working hours and, if required, over the weekend. This situation was unforeseen, and I sincerely appreciate your understanding and support.
