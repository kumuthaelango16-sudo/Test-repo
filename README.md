Reverted all pipelines to the Static Worker Node (09/02) due to a pod anti-affinity issue.

As discussed on 11/13, the team is testing additional scenarios, including:

Load testing across all 19 worker nodes

Failure scenario validations

During failure testing, the team identified an issue with new resource and limits configuration in the pod template.

All details shared with the vendor; they will respond by Thursday (12/4).
